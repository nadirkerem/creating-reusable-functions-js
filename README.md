# Creating Reusable Functions - Per Scholas Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains a series of exercises that focus on creating and testing reusable functions as part of the Per Scholas Software Engineering Program. These exercises enhance understanding of functional programming, object manipulation, and critical thinking in data processing.

## Contents

- **part1.js**: Introduces basic functions for arithmetic calculations, string operations, and recursive printing to demonstrate core programming principles.
- **part2.js**: Enhances array handling through JavaScript methods and callback functions for sorting, filtering, and data transformation.
- **part3.js**: Focuses on object manipulation, including modifying and copying objects to illustrate handling by reference and value.

## Usage

To run any of the scripts, ensure you have Node.js installed. Execute a specific script by using the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node part1.js
node part2.js
node part3.js
```

## Testing
